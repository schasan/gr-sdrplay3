# fmradio

Demo sdrplay interface to receive frequency modulated radio

# cwradio

Supposed to become:
Receive cw via sdrplay and decode.

# cwdecode

Up to now creates an arbitrary beep pattern, converts into digital via rectifier follows by RC.
Then analyze timing in Python module to automatically clusterize dash and dots, letter space, word space and pause.
Using scikits kMean "machine learning" to interpret incoming signal sequence.
